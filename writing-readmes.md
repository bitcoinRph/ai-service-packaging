# Writing Service READMEs

Every StartOS package README should document **how your service on StartOS differs from the upstream version**. Users should be able to read your README and understand exactly what's different — everything else, they can find in the upstream docs.

## Philosophy

**Don't duplicate upstream documentation.** If something isn't mentioned in your README, users should assume the upstream docs are accurate.

Write for two audiences:

1. **Humans** — clear, scannable, with practical examples
2. **AI assistants** — structured data that can be parsed programmatically

## Recommended Structure

````markdown
# [Service Name] on StartOS

> **Upstream docs:** <https://docs.example.com/>
>
> Everything not listed in this document should behave the same as upstream
> [Service Name] [version]. If a feature, setting, or behavior is not mentioned
> here, the upstream documentation is accurate and fully applicable.

[Brief description of what the service does and link to upstream repo]

## Table of Contents

[Links to each section]

---

## Image and Container Runtime

[Image source, architectures, entrypoint modifications]

## Volume and Data Layout

[Mount points, data directories, StartOS-specific files like store.json]

## Installation and First-Run Flow

[How setup differs from upstream — skipped wizards, auto-configuration, initial credentials]

## Configuration Management

[Which settings are managed by StartOS vs configurable via upstream methods]

## Network Access and Interfaces

[Exposed ports, protocols, access methods]

## Actions (StartOS UI)

[Each action: name, purpose, availability, inputs/outputs]

## Backups and Restore

[What's backed up, restore behavior]

## Health Checks

[Endpoint, grace period, messages]

## Limitations and Differences

[Numbered list of key limitations compared to upstream]

## What Is Unchanged from Upstream

[Explicit list of features that work exactly as documented upstream]

## Contributing

[Link to CONTRIBUTING.md]

## Quick Reference for AI Consumers

```yaml
package_id: string
upstream_version: string
image: string
architectures: [list]
volumes:
  volume_name: mount_path
ports:
  interface_name: port_number
dependencies: [list or "none"]
startos_managed_env_vars:
  - VAR_NAME
actions:
  - action-id

## AI Prompt for Generating Documentation

Use this prompt with an AI assistant to generate your README. Replace `[Service Name]` and `[service-name]` with your actual service name:

---

**PROMPT:**

> We're packaging [Service Name] for StartOS. I need you to write a README.md that documents ONLY how our StartOS package differs from running [Service Name] in a standard Docker/Docker Compose setup.
>
> **Your task:**
>
> 1. Read the entire `[service-name]-startos` codebase — manifest, actions, main.ts, interfaces, backups, fileModels, install/versions, everything
> 2. Cross-reference with the upstream docs at `upstreamRepo` in `startos/manifest/index.ts`
> 3. Write a README that serves as a "diff" against upstream
>
> **Key principle:** If something isn't in our README, users should assume upstream docs are accurate. Don't duplicate upstream documentation.
>
> **Required sections:**
>
> - **Image and Container Runtime** — same image or custom? architectures? entrypoint changes?
> - **Volume and Data Layout** — mount points, any StartOS-specific files (store.json), database setup
> - **Installation and First-Run Flow** — skipped wizards, auto-generated credentials, pre-configured settings, initial setup tasks
> - **Configuration Management** — table of settings managed by StartOS (env vars, actions) vs settings users configure via upstream methods
> - **Network Access and Interfaces** — ports, protocols, access methods (LAN IP, .local, .onion, custom domains all work on StartOS 0.4.0)
> - **Actions** — document each action: name, purpose, visibility, when available, inputs, outputs
> - **Backups and Restore** — what's backed up, restore behavior
> - **Health Checks** — endpoint, grace period, messages
> - **Limitations and Differences** — numbered list of things that don't work or work differently
> - **What Is Unchanged** — explicit list confirming what works exactly like upstream
>
> **End with a YAML block** for AI consumers containing: package_id, upstream_version, image, architectures, volumes, ports, dependencies, startos_managed_env_vars, actions
>
> **Do NOT include:**
>
> - Build instructions (those go in CONTRIBUTING.md)
> - Generic descriptions of what the service does (link to upstream instead)
> - Information that matches upstream exactly (only document differences)
>
> **Tone:** Technical, concise, scannable. Use tables where comparing StartOS vs upstream behavior.

## Sections to Document

### Image and Container Runtime

| What to Document | Example                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Image source     | Upstream unmodified, or custom Dockerfile |
| Architectures    | x86_64, aarch64, riscv64                  |
| Entrypoint       | Default or custom                         |

### Volume and Data Layout

| What to Document | Example                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Volume names     | `main`, `data`, `config`             |
| Mount points     | `/data`, `/config`                   |
| StartOS files    | `store.json` for persistent settings |
| Database         | Embedded SQLite vs external          |

### Installation and First-Run Flow

Document if your package:

- Skips an upstream setup wizard
- Auto-generates credentials
- Pre-configures settings
- Creates tasks for initial setup

### Configuration Management

| StartOS-Managed                          | Upstream-Managed                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Settings controlled via actions/env vars | Settings configurable via app's own UI/config |

### Actions

For each action:

- **Name**: What users see
- **Purpose**: What it does
- **Visibility**: Visible, hidden, or conditional
- **Availability**: Any status, only running, only stopped
- **Inputs**: What users provide
- **Outputs**: Credentials, confirmation, etc.

### Network Interfaces

For each interface:

- Port number
- Protocol (HTTP, SSH, etc.)
- Purpose (UI, API, etc.)
- Access methods (LAN IP, .local, .onion, custom domains)

### Backups

- What volumes/data are included
- Data NOT backed up (if any)
- Restore behavior

### Health Checks

- Endpoint or method
- Grace period
- Success/failure messages

### Limitations

Be explicit about:

- Features that don't work or work differently
- Unavailable configuration options
- Unsupported dependencies
- Version-specific limitations

### AI Quick Reference

End with a YAML block for machine parsing.
